# Data Science Internship Task

## Internship Details
- **Company:** Codtech IT Solution Pvt. Ltd.
- **Intern Name:** Pritam Balkrishna Meshram
- **Intern ID:** CT04WT68
- **Domain:** Data Science
- **Duration:** 4 Weeks
- **Mentor:** Neela Santhosh
---
## Project Description
This project focuses on performing comprehensive **data preprocessing** on the Titanic dataset. The dataset contains passenger information such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and survival status. Data preprocessing is a critical step in the data science and machine learning pipeline, as raw data often contains missing values, inconsistencies, and categorical features that need to be transformed.
---
## Tasks Performed
- Imported and explored the dataset using Pandas
- Analyzed data structure using `.head()`, `.info()`, and `.describe()`
- Handled missing values:
  - Filled missing **Age** values using the median
  - Filled missing **Embarked** values using the mode
- Removed duplicate records to maintain data integrity
- Encoded categorical variables such as **Sex** and **Embarked**
- Applied feature scaling using **StandardScaler**
- Saved the cleaned and preprocessed dataset for further analysis

---

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation
- **NumPy** – numerical operations
- **Scikit-learn (sklearn.preprocessing)** – encoding and scaling

## Outcome
This project strengthened my understanding of:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques
- Handling real-world datasets
- Preparing data for machine learning models
- End-to-end data analytics workflow

This repository demonstrates my ability to transform raw data into a clean, structured format ready for analysis or model building.
